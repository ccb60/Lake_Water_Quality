# Data Sources 

## Maine Lakes and Ponds
###  Geospatial Data
Maine Geolibrary / Maine Office of GIS no longer provides a lakes data layer
containing the MIDAS numbers of all Maine lakes. They refer users to the
National Hydrography Dataset for all hydrologic features, but the National
Hydrography Database does not contain MIDAS numbers.

We need the MIDAS numbers to connect water quality monitoring data unambiguously
with specific Maine Lakes, because many Maine lakes have similar names.

Geospatial Data on Maine lake centroids was downloaded as a KMZ file from
Maine DEP's website by Curtis C. Bohlen on November 23, 2020. Details of 
how to access these data, and combine them with the national hydrography
database are provided in the
[Maine_Lakes_MIDAS](https://github.com/ccb60/Maine_Lakes_MIDAS)
repository.

## Water Quality Data
Maine's Department of Environmental Protection aggregates data on water
quality from volunteer water quality monitors, state agencies and other
sources, and posts it on-line.  Data and information is accessible on a lake
by lake basis via the [Lakes of Maine](https://www.lakesofmaine.org/) website. 
Aggregate data is housed as excel files on the website of the 
[Gulf of Maine Council for the Marine Environment](http://www.gulfofmaine.org),
as part of their "Knowledge Base".

Because the actual data is buried several layers deep on these web sites, we
created a Python 3 script, `ExtractLakeWQData.py` to access and download the
state-wide lake water quality data. URLs and many other details are hard
coded in the script. 

Available raw water quality data includes:
1.  Chlorophyll A
2.  pH, alkalinity and related water quality parameters
3.  Phosphorus concentrations
4.  Secchi Depths
5.  Vertical temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles

Summary tables(both annual, and including all records) provide averages for
water quality parameters, including:  
*  Secchi Depth,  
*  Color,   
*  Chlorophyll A,  
*  pH,  
*  Alkalinity,  
*  Conductivity,  
*  Total Phosphorus, and  
*  Trophic State Index (TSI) calculated several different ways.  
Measures of variability are not provided.  Sample sizes are not clear (number of
"months" of data are indicated, not number of observations). Right Censored
Secchi Depths are not fully addressed.

## Lake Morphometry
Data on morphometry of many Maine lakes and ponds was accessed here:
